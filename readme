 IPANEMAP : Integrative Probing Analysis of Nucleic Acids Empowered by Multiple Accessibility Profiles
A directed sampling from the conformation space of secondary structures, followed by a clustering of the similar structures from  condition. The output is a set of accurate centroid structures verifying certain optimality criteria.
Output centroids are in the folder "Multiprobing"

Set-up issues:

This version requires the use of:
1- ViennaRNA-2.3.1, be sure to use a version above 2.0
2- VARNAv3-93.jar should be in the working repository.


Launch the program: python2.7 IPANEMAP.py

***************************************************************Configuration: 
IPANEMAP.Config: correponds to the configuration file

Parameters that should be set:
 -constraint, example: constraints: 1M7,1M7MG,NMIA
 -numberofsruct: number of strcutures generqted for each condition, once the value is fixed a folder OutputSamples'numberofsruct' is created.

***************************************************************Input folders:

-Constraints_probing: contains constraint files with reactivity file. for each probing condition two files are required: RnaCondition.fa and RnaConditionProbing.txt where RnaCondition.fa: is a fasta file (sequence) with the identifier >Rnacondition(reagent name)

-fasta_files: fasta file of the studied RNA Rna.fa

-Constraints_Hard: Contains files with hard constraints

*************************************************************Output folders:

 - Multiprobing contains predicted structures in dot-bracket format
 - output with all the clustering properties.
 - logfile: Sampling, clustering and Pareto selection results.
