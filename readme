IPANEMAP tool for an Integrative Probing Analysis of Nucleic Acids Empowered by Multiple Accessibility Profiles.

A sampling from the conformational space of RNA secondary structures, under different probing constraints, followed by an iterative clustering to find structures at the intersection of the various considered constraints.

The output is a centroid structure that could be found in the folder "Multiprobing".

Set-up issues:

This version requires the use of:
1- ViennaRNA-2.3.1, be sure to use a version above 2.0
2- VARNAv3-93.jar should be in the working repository.


Launch the program: python2.7 IPANEMAP.py

***************************************************************Configuration: 
IPANEMAP.Config: correponds to the configuration file

Parameters that should be set:
 -constraint, example: constraints: 1M7,1M7MG,NMIA
 -numberofsruct: number of strcutures generqted for each condition, once the value is fixed a folder OutputSamples'numberofsruct' is created.

***************************************************************Input folders:

-Constraints_probing: contains constraint files with reactivity file. for each probing condition two files are required: RnaCondition.fa and RnaConditionProbing.txt where RnaCondition.fa: is a fasta file (sequence) with the identifier >Rnacondition(reagent name)

-fasta_files: fasta file of the studied RNA Rna.fa

-Constraints_Hard: Contains files with hard constraints

*************************************************************Output folders:

 - Multiprobing contains predicted structures in dot-bracket format
 - output with all the clustering properties.
 - logfile: Sampling, clustering and Pareto selection results.
